// Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

// The binary number returned should be a string.

// Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

// 1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
// 5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
// BINARYFUNDAMENTALS

const addBinary = ( a,b ) => (a + b).toString(2)



// standard programming is base-10
// base-10 system has 9 digits, 0 - 9
// each digit position is based to the power of 10
